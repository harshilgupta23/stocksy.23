This project is a Class 12 Capstone Project based on an AI-powered stock prediction system. It uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, which is a type of machine learning model used to analyze past stock prices and understand trends over time. The main aim of this project is to help beginners learn how stock predictions work, not to give real investment advice.

The application allows users to choose a stock, select whether they want to buy or sell, enter an investment amount, and decide the number of days they want to hold the stock. Based on this information, the system shows useful results such as the last closing price, predicted trend, and a simple decision like Buy, Sell, or Hold. These results are shown in a clear and easy way so that even users with no stock market knowledge can understand them.

The project is built as a Streamlit-based web application and uses popular Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, and Yahoo Finance. It also includes graphs and visual charts to make stock trends easier to understand.

Only US stock market data is used in this project because accurate Indian stock data is not freely available and lacks proper support for machine learning models. Overall, this project shows how AI and machine learning can be used in real-life applications and helps students understand basic concepts of stock markets, data analysis, and web-based AI systems.
